# angular-minimodal

A small but flexible library for dealing with modals in AngularJS

# Browser support

This module has been built with the HTML5 `dialog`-tag in mind. It will therefore only work with browsers which supports `dialog`. See [w3.org](http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#the-dialog-element) for more info on `dialog`.

However, work has begun on adapters for the most popular libraries which do modals, for example Bootstrap.

Current browser support can be found on [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=dialog).
